# Football data visualization using Tableau
 I use Tableau and its various features to visualize some of the highlights from the Veikkausliiga season 2020 data and create a highly interactive, informative and engaging dashboard. The file (Veikkausliiga 2020_dashboard.twb) contains 1 main dashboard comprising of 6 separate workbooks each of which analyse a particular metric using the free (limited) data available to download in CSV format from https://fbref.com/en/
